Hey there! I'm Deb, a Machine Learning enthusiast and researcher with a passion for solving real world problems using AI. My journey has taken me through diverse domains from advancing hearing science and building specialized large language models to developing AI-driven medical imaging solutions and designing scalable ML architectures that serve millions of users globally.

Currently, I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, where I'm building intelligent multi-agent systems specialized for the banking domain with adaptive learning capabilities that continuously improve from real world interactions. My work focuses on creating AI solutions that make banking interactions more seamless and intuitive empowering both bankers and customers with tools that understand context, anticipate needs, and deliver personalized experiences at scale.

Previously, at the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL), I worked at the frontier of hearing science and technology, creating intelligent prescription systems that adapt to dynamic environments using advanced ML and agentic modeling. Before that, I developed AI-powered diagnostic solutions for epilepsy using generative adversarial networks, helping neurologists make better informed treatment decisions. My experience also spans designing personalized recommendation engines, ML pipelines, and real time analytics platforms deployed globally across retail and enterprise sectors.

Outside of work, I'm a strong believer in open source and actively contribute to projects in the AI community. I'm particularly excited about efficient on device AI computation for edge applications and democratizing access to advanced AI technologies.

If you're into AI, multi agent systems, or just curious about where the field is heading, let's connect!
