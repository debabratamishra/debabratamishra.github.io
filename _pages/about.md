Hey there! I'm Deb, a Machine Learning enthusiast and researcher with a passion for solving real-world problems using AI. My journey has taken me through diverse domains and problem statements— from optimizing hearing aid algorithms and building specialized large language models, improving reasoning capabilities in large language models to developing AI-driven medical imaging solutions and designing scalable ML architectures across multiple domains.

Currently, I’m at the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) where I’m working in the frontier of advancing hearing science and technology. Over here, my core area of research focuses on improving hearing aid fitting prescriptions and exploring the potential of agentic modeling to enhance personalized auditory solutions.

Before this, I worked on developing AI-powered diagnostic solutions for epilepsy, helping neurologists make better-informed decisions for patient treatment with direct applications of generative adversarial networks, and have also designed personalized recommendation engines, ML pipelines, and real-time analytics platforms deployed globally.

Beyond my work, I’m deeply interested in open-source AI, efficient on-device AI computation for edge applications and recently, I’m exploring its applications in robotics.
