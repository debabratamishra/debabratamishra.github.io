Hey there! I'm Deb, a Machine Learning enthusiast and researcher with a passion for solving real world problems using AI. My journey has taken me through diverse domains and problem statements from optimizing hearing aid algorithms and building specialized large language models, improving reasoning capabilities in large language models to developing AI driven medical imaging solutions and designing scalable ML architectures across multiple domains.

Currently, I’m at the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) where I’m working in the frontier of advancing hearing science and technology using advanced ML. My focus is on creating intelligent prescription systems that adapt to dynamic environments and exploring how agentic modeling can make auditory solutions more personalized and effective.

Before this, I worked on developing AI-powered diagnostic solutions for epilepsy, helping neurologists make better informed decisions for patient treatment with direct applications of generative adversarial networks, and have also designed personalized recommendation engines, ML pipelines, and real time analytics platforms deployed globally.

Outside of work, I’m a strong believer in open source and love contributing to projects in the AI community. I’m especially excited about efficient on device AI computation for edge applications and the role it can play in making advanced AI more accessible.

If you’re into AI or just curious about where the field is heading, let’s connect!
