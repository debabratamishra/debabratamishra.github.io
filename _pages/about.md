Hey there! I'm Deb, a Machine Learning enthusiast and researcher with a passion for solving real-world problems using AI. My journey has taken me through diverse domains and problem statements— from optimizing hearing aid algorithms and building specialized large language models, improving reasoning capabilities in large language models to developing AI-driven medical imaging solutions and designing scalable ML architectures for the retail industry.

Currently, I’m at the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) where I’m working in the frontier of advancing hearing science and technology. My core area of research focuses on improving hearing aid fitting prescriptions and exploring the potential of agentic modeling to enhance personalized auditory solutions.

Before this, I worked on developing AI-powered diagnostic solutions for epilepsy, helping neurologists make better-informed decisions for patient treatment and have also designed personalized recommendation systems, ML pipelines, and real-time customer analytics solutions in the past, that are being used worldwide in the retail sector.

Beyond my work, I’m deeply interested in open-source AI, Efficient on-device AI computation for edge applications and recently, I’ve started exploring quantum machine learning.
